For those familiar with Git:

    git clone git@github.com:acrepet/programmez.git

Or if you prefer using Subversion:

    svn co http://svn.github.com/acrepet/programmez.git programmez.git

Once checked out, you can build from the command line using Maven 3.
You can simply type:

    >$ mvn test

If you're using an IDE that supports Maven-based projects, you can import the
project directly from its POM.  Otherwise, generate IDE metadata with

    >$ mvn eclipse:eclipse
        - or -
    >$ mvn idea:idea
